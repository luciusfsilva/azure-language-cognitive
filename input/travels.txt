I believe that holidays should be a change.

Most people like a change. If they live in the country they like to go to a big town and spend their time looking at the shop windows and visiting cinemas, theatres and museums.

If they live in the city, they like to go the some quiet place in the hills or by the sea, do nothing but walking, swimming or lying in the sun.

So, on holidays most people donâ€™t like doing things they have to do all year round.
